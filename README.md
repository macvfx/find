## Notes

- Find files with file names greater than 140 characters (move and archive) or find trailing spaces at the end of a directory name and rewrite the name. Variant with extra logging and a confirmation step to see the list of changes before changing them. Use with caution. **Test before using. Always have backups.**
- Find photos scripts: get creation date using stat command, make folders and sort or get the creation date from EXIF data, make folders and sort
- Find all R3D files and make image thumbnails from ALL of the r3d files in a given directory **or** make ONLY 1 image thumbnail from the r3d files found in a given RDC directory

## Add or Remove Headers Script Notes

- Find shell scripts in the default path and add a header
- Adds header after shebang (#!) if present
- Removes header exactly if --rm is specified
- Skips duplicates
- Preserves timestamps
- Supports dry-run
- Colored output, counters, recursive search, custom file pattern/path
