# find
## Find stuff with Unix find

### Examples of Unix Find scripts

1. find-photos-sort.sh ** Find photos, get creation date using stat command, make folders and sort**
2. find-mdls-exif.sh ** Find photos, get the creation date from EXIF data, make folders and sort **
3. find-trailing-space-replace.sh ** Find directories with trailing space and rename them **
4. findspace-log.sh ** Find trailing spaces, make the change and log to a file **

## Notes

- Find photos scripts: get creation date using stat command, make folders and sort or get the creation date from EXIF data, make folders and sort
- Find trailing spaces at the end of a directory name and rewrite the name. Variant with extra logging. Use with caution. **Test before using. Always have backups.**
